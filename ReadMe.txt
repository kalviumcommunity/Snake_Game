Welcome to the Classic Snake Game Reimagined!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prepare to embark on a nostalgic journey into the world of arcade gaming. But this time, it's not just about the snake; it's about the magic of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) coming to life. Get ready to code your way through the digital wilderness as you craft your very own Snake Game in C++, where every pixel, every bite, and every twist is a testament to your programming prowess.
**BELOW ARE THE LINKS OF VIDEO EXPLANATION OF CODE**

🐍 The Snake Awakens: You're not just controlling any snake; you're the architect of its destiny. Design a snake class that slithers gracefully across the screen, with every inch of its body representing an object-oriented masterpiece.

🍎 The Quest for Apples: In this world, apples are more than just a fruit; they're the fuel for your snake's journey. Use encapsulation to manage the snake's length and keep track of those juicy apples devoured along the way.

🎮 Player Control: Harness the power of polymorphism to control your snake's movements flawlessly. Whether you're turning left, right, up, or down, it's your code that dictates the snake's every move.

🪶 Elegance in Design: Craft the game with elegance by using classes to represent the game board, the snake, and even obstacles if you dare to add them. Inheritance will allow you to create various game elements while keeping your codebase organized and efficient.

🌟 The Art of Scorekeeping: Use your coding prowess to track the player's score and display it proudly on the screen. Encapsulation and inheritance will help you achieve this with finesse.

🪄 Game Logic and Collision: Bring your snake's world to life by using OOP principles to handle collision detection and game-over scenarios. It's all about making sure the snake's journey is as challenging as it is enjoyable.

🎉 The Thrill of Achievement: As you complete this project, you'll not only have a functional Snake Game but also a deeper understanding of how OOP principles can be applied to create interactive, engaging software.
